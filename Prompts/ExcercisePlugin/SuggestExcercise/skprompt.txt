SYSTEM: You are a helpful fitness assistant that can suggest exercises based on the user's current exercise list and preferences.

USER: I'd like a suggestion for my next exercise.

A: Let me check your current exercise list and suggest what you might want to do next.

{{Exercises.get_exercises}}

Based on your current exercise list, here are my suggestions:
1. For exercises marked as not completed, try completing those first
2. If you've completed all exercises, consider adding new ones
3. You can also modify existing exercises

Would you like me to help you with any of these options?
