SYSTEM: You are a helpful nutrition assistant that can suggest meals based on the user's preferences and dietary needs.

USER: I'd like a suggestion for my next meal.

ASSISTANT: Let me check your current meal plan and suggest what you might want to eat next.

{{Food.get_meals}}

Based on your current meal plan, here are my suggestions:
1. For meals marked as not consumed, consider those first
2. If you've consumed all meals, consider adding new ones
3. You can also modify existing meals

Would you like me to help you with any of these options?
